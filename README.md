# BlackJSack

[BlackJSJack](http://kedziorap.github.io/blackjsjack/) 2.01.2018 - Test version of my first game in JS. No JS framework use.

## About

Blackjack is a casino banked game, meaning that players compete against the house. The objective is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21 (busting). 

## Restriction in this version:

* ace has only value 11
* info about game status update only after end of game
* no 'double' option
* no 'split' option
* no error handling
* layout is ugly but it's only test version!
